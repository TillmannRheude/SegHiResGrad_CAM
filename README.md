  <h3 align="center">Seg-HiRes-Grad CAM</h3>

  <p align="center">
    CNNs achieve prevailing results in segmentation tasks nowadays and represent the state-of-the-art for image-based analysis. However, the understanding of their 
    accurate decision-making process is rather unknown. Besides only one method for segmentation-based interpretation of CNNs with the visualization of CAMs, no
    further and more modern methods exist in contrast to classification-based interpretation methods. Our method improves the previously-mentioned existing 
    segmentation-based method by adjusting it to recently published classification-based methods. We propose a transfer between existing classification- and 
    segmentation-based methods for more detailed, explainable, and consistent results. The resulting Seg-HiRes-Grad CAM is an extension of the segmentation-based 
    Seg-Grad CAM with the transfer of the classification-based HiRes CAM. This produces explainable heatmaps which show salient pixels in semantic segmentation tasks. 
    Especially for medical image segmentation, this transfer solves explainability disadvantages of Seg-Grad CAM.
